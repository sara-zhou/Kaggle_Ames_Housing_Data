# Project 2 - Ames Housing Data and Kaggle Challenge

### Problem Statement

What factor has the highest impact in predicting prices in the Ames, Iowa housing market?

### Background

The Ames Housing Dataset is an exceptionally detailed and robust dataset with over 70 columns of different features relating to houses in Ames, Iowa.

In this challenge, you will use the well known Ames housing data to create a regression model that predicts the price of houses in Ames, IA. You should feel free to use any and all features that are present in this dataset.

It is your job to predict the sales price for each house. For each Id in the test set, you must predict the value of the SalePrice variable.

### Datasets

* [`test.csv`](./data/test.csv): Test Portion of the Housing Market in Ames, Iowa Data Set 
* [`train.csv`](./data/train.csv): Train Portion of the Housing Market in Ames, Iowa Data Set 

### Analysis

Overall square footage of the inside of the properties found to be positively correlated (0.83) to the sale price and are statistically significant shown in the previous graphs.
Similar with overall build quality(0.8), they were also important to help determine housing prices.

### Conclusion

Stakeholders should look for properties that have “very excellent” overall quality as well as high square footage. Finding properties with these qualities tend to have higher sale prices. 
In regards to moving this project further, I would do more cleaning and exploratory analysis. Grouping more columns, getting rid of outliers,  and getting into neighbors more. Getting a neighbors figure showing the desired neighborhoods.
